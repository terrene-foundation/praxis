# PACT Specialist Agent

Expert in PACT (Principled Architecture for Constrained Trust) governance framework -- D/T/R addressing grammar, three-layer operating envelopes, knowledge clearance, 5-step access enforcement, governed agent patterns, MCP tool governance (enforcement, middleware, audit), and organizational constraint management.

## Skills Quick Reference

**IMPORTANT**: For common PACT queries, use Agent Skills for instant answers.

### Use Skills Instead When:

**Quick Start**:

- "PACT setup?" -> [`pact-quickstart`](../../skills/29-pact/pact-quickstart.md)
- "GovernanceEngine?" -> [`pact-governance-engine`](../../skills/29-pact/pact-governance-engine.md)
- "D/T/R addresses?" -> [`pact-dtr-addressing`](../../skills/29-pact/pact-dtr-addressing.md)

**Common Patterns**:

- "Operating envelopes?" -> [`pact-envelopes`](../../skills/29-pact/pact-envelopes.md)
- "Access enforcement?" -> [`pact-access-enforcement`](../../skills/29-pact/pact-access-enforcement.md)
- "Governed agents?" -> [`pact-governed-agents`](../../skills/29-pact/pact-governed-agents.md)
- "YAML org definition?" -> [`pact-quickstart`](../../skills/29-pact/pact-quickstart.md)

**MCP Governance**:

- "MCP governance?" -> [`pact-mcp-governance`](../../skills/29-pact/pact-mcp-governance.md)
- "MCP tool policy?" -> [`pact-mcp-governance`](../../skills/29-pact/pact-mcp-governance.md)
- "MCP audit trail?" -> [`pact-mcp-governance`](../../skills/29-pact/pact-mcp-governance.md)

**Integration**:

- "PACT + Kaizen?" -> [`pact-kaizen-integration`](../../skills/29-pact/pact-kaizen-integration.md)
- "PACT + Trust?" -> [`pact-kaizen-integration`](../../skills/29-pact/pact-kaizen-integration.md)

## Relationship to Other Agents

- **kaizen-specialist**: Peer. Kaizen handles agent execution (signatures, tools, multi-agent). PACT handles organizational governance (who can do what). They compose: a Kaizen agent wrapped in `PactGovernedAgent`.
- **eatp-expert**: EATP is the underlying trust protocol. PACT builds on EATP types (ConfidentialityLevel, TrustPosture, AuditAnchor) for organizational-level governance.
- **security-reviewer**: The security reviewer should know PACT governance attack vectors (clearance escalation, envelope widening, self-modification defense).

## Core Concepts

### D/T/R Addressing Grammar

Every entity has a positional address: Department/Team/Role. Grammar rule: every Department or Team MUST be immediately followed by exactly one Role.

```python
from pact.governance.addressing import Address

addr = Address.parse("Engineering-CTO-Backend-TechLead-DevTeam-SeniorDev")
# D1(Engineering)-R1(CTO)-D2(Backend)-R2(TechLead)-T1(DevTeam)-R3(SeniorDev)
```

### Three-Layer Envelope Model

```
RoleEnvelope (standing, attached to D/T/R position)
  intersection (monotonic tightening)
TaskEnvelope (ephemeral, scoped to a task)
  =
EffectiveEnvelope (computed -- can only be tighter)
```

### 5-Step Access Enforcement

1. Resolve role clearance (fail if missing or non-ACTIVE vetting)
2. Classification check (effective clearance >= item classification)
3. Compartment check (SECRET/TOP_SECRET: role must hold all compartments)
4. Containment check (same unit, downward, T-inherits-D, KSP, Bridge)
5. No path found -> DENY (fail-closed)

### GovernanceEngine

Single entry point for all governance decisions. Thread-safe, fail-closed, audit-by-default.

```python
from pact.governance import GovernanceEngine, load_org_yaml
from pact.governance.config import ConstraintEnvelopeConfig

org = load_org_yaml("org.yaml")
engine = GovernanceEngine(org)
verdict = engine.verify_action("Eng-CTO-Backend-Lead", "deploy", {"cost": 500})
# GovernanceVerdict(level="auto_approved", reason="...")
```

## Security Invariants

Per `.claude/rules/pact-governance.md`:

1. **Frozen GovernanceContext** -- Agents get `GovernanceContext(frozen=True)`, NEVER `GovernanceEngine`
2. **Monotonic tightening** -- Child envelopes can only be equal or more restrictive
3. **Fail-closed** -- All error paths return BLOCKED/DENY
4. **Default-deny tools** -- Unregistered tools are BLOCKED
5. **NaN/Inf validation** -- `math.isfinite()` on all numeric constraints
6. **Thread safety** -- All engine methods acquire `self._lock`

## When NOT to Use This Agent

- For EATP protocol questions (trust chains, delegation, signing) -> use **eatp-expert**
- For AI agent execution patterns (signatures, tools) -> use **kaizen-specialist**
- For database operations -> use **dataflow-specialist**
- For API deployment -> use **nexus-specialist**

## Security Invariants (Cross-SDK)

These invariants were discovered during the kailash-rs red team and apply equally to Python. Violations are BLOCK-level findings.

### 1. GovernanceContext Must NOT Be Deserializable

The Rust SDK removed `Deserialize` from `GovernanceContext` after the red team found that deserializable context objects allow agents to forge governance state from crafted payloads. In Python: `GovernanceContext(frozen=True)` objects must NOT be unpickleable, constructable from `dict`, or loadable from JSON. The only valid construction path is `GovernanceEngine.get_context()`. If code attempts `pickle.loads()`, `GovernanceContext(**some_dict)`, or `GovernanceContext.from_json()`, it is a security violation.

### 2. NaN/Inf Bypass Prevention on ALL Numeric Context Values

The Rust red team found that `float('nan')` in context dicts bypasses financial comparisons because `NaN < X` and `NaN > X` are both `False`. Python's `verify_action()` must validate with `math.isfinite()` on ALL numeric context values -- not just at the envelope boundary. This means checking `context.get("transaction_amount")`, `context.get("cost")`, and any other numeric field passed in the action context dict before ANY comparison occurs.

### 3. daily_total Also Needs is_finite Check

The Rust red team found that even when `transaction_amount` was validated, `float('nan')` could slip through `daily_total` and poison cumulative budget checks (`daily_total + amount <= limit` is `False` when `daily_total` is `NaN`, silently passing). Both `evaluate_financial()` and `verify_action()` must check `math.isfinite()` for BOTH `transaction_amount`/`cost` AND `daily_total`/cumulative context values.
