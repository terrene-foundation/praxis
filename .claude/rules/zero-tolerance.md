# Zero-Tolerance Enforcement Rules

## Scope

These rules apply to ALL sessions, ALL agents, ALL code changes, ALL phases. They are ABSOLUTE and NON-NEGOTIABLE. There is NO flexibility on any of these rules.

## ABSOLUTE RULE 1: Pre-Existing Failures MUST Be Resolved

When tests, red team validation, code review, or any analysis reveals a pre-existing failure:

**YOU MUST FIX IT.** Period.

"It was not introduced in this session" is NOT an acceptable response. If you found it, you own it.

**Required response to ANY pre-existing failure:**

1. Diagnose the root cause
2. Implement the fix
3. Write a regression test that fails without the fix and passes with it
4. Verify the fix with `pytest`
5. Include the fix in the current commit or a dedicated fix commit

**BLOCKED responses:**

- "This is a pre-existing issue, not introduced in this session"
- "This failure exists in the current codebase and is outside the scope of this change"
- "Noting this as a known issue for future resolution"
- ANY response that acknowledges a failure without fixing it

**The only acceptable exception:** The user explicitly says "skip this issue" or "ignore this for now."

## ABSOLUTE RULE 2: No Stubs, Placeholders, or Deferred Implementation — EVER

Stubs are BLOCKED. No approval process. No exceptions. The validate-workflow hook exits with code 2 (BLOCK) on detection.

Full detection patterns and enforcement: see `rules/no-stubs.md`.

## ABSOLUTE RULE 3: No Naive Fallbacks or Error Hiding

Hiding errors behind `except: pass`, `return None`, or silent discards is BLOCKED.

Full detection patterns and acceptable exceptions: see `rules/no-stubs.md` Section 3.

## ABSOLUTE RULE 4: No Workarounds for Core SDK Issues

When you encounter a bug in the SDK:

**DO NOT work around it. DO NOT re-implement it naively.**

File a GitHub issue on the SDK repository (`terrene-foundation/kailash-py`) with a minimal reproduction. Use a supported alternative pattern if one exists.

**BLOCKED:** Naive re-implementations, post-processing to "fix" SDK output, downgrading to avoid bugs.

## ABSOLUTE RULE 5: Version Consistency on Release

When releasing ANY package, ALL version locations MUST be updated atomically:

1. `pyproject.toml` → `version = "X.Y.Z"`
2. `src/{package}/__init__.py` → `__version__ = "X.Y.Z"`

The session-start hook checks this automatically. **A release with mismatched versions is BLOCKED.**

## Enforcement

1. **validate-workflow.js hook** — BLOCKS stubs and error hiding in production code
2. **user-prompt-rules-reminder.js hook** — Injects zero-tolerance reminders every message
3. **session-start.js hook** — Checks package freshness and COC sync status
4. **intermediate-reviewer agent** — Validates compliance during code review
5. **security-reviewer agent** — Validates compliance during security review

## Language Policy

Every "MUST" means "MUST." Every "BLOCKED" means the operation WILL NOT proceed. Every "NO" means "NO."
